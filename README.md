# LabelnotUsed
A tool to check tex or txt file using for academia writing. Checking the labels that are not used but labeled. Written as python file.


To use this tool, download it in the folder where the file you want to check is located(or type in a very long name). Then run the file using python IDE. The filename will be needed. You will either see an output of all the labels that are not been used with its line or the output will be writen in a file for easier checking process.

This work is collaborated with [@Andrew](https://github.com/andrewhywong).
